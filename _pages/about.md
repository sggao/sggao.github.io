Welcome to my homepage!

I am currently a Quantitative Researcher in Systematic Equities at [Citadel Securities](https://www.citadelsecurities.com/).

Prior to joining Citadel Securities, I obtained my Ph.D. in [Statistics and Data Science](https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/) at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania in May 2023, where I was fortunate to be advised by Professor [Zongming Ma](https://zmastat.github.io/). My research interests include high dimensional statistics as well as differential privacy and deep learning. I am also interested in the intersection of AI and bioinformatics.

I obtained the Bachelor of Art (B.A.) in Mathematics and the Master of Mathematics (M.Math.) Degrees from the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) before attending the Wharton School. I was advised by Professor [Rajen Shah](http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~rds37/) on research in high dimensional statistics.
